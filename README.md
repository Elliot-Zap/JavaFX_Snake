# JavaFX_Snake

Update 0.9.0.1 May-4-2018

Snake now dies. If it touches a wall, or itself. It pauses the game and resets player position randomly.

You can pause with Enter, and resume with any other key.



------------------------------------------------------

Basic Snake game running on JavaFX 2
Decided to work on another little side project. 
Using what I've learned so far in my Java course, I wanted to test my JavaFX knowledge with this little game.

Using GridPanes, Squares and Timeline Loops, I'm almost 85% done with the game, Snake eats and grows.
Just need to add the lose conditions and that should do it.

The game for now starts automatically. (So I need to add I title screen/pause screen)
